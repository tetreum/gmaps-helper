# GMaps Helper

UI to get quadrants in GMaps easily.

## Requirements

A [Google Console project](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/) with the following APIs enabled:
- Geocoding API
- Maps JavaScript API
- Places API

Since you can't limit Google Console budgets to 0â‚¬ (because fuck you -Google) remember to limit the quota to avoid surprises.

How many free requests has Maps API? Who knows, documentation/interface is garbage. 

If you check https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing/ it says they give you 200$/month for free to spend on whatever you want.

## Setup

1. Open index.html and replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` with your API key (get it from https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/credentials).
2. Done!
